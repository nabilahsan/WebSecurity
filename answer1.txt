Problem 1:
Mr. Moran,

The exchange will happen on October 7th at midnight. Do not be late.
I have sent further instructions in a separate message, which you may find at:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AKnkcoQzDR8uac2nfqOrN6hs9-MO6uHG?usp=sharing

To protect the secrecy of my message, I have hidden it among thousands of decoy messages. Those foolish detectives will never find out which one is the real message!
You may identify the real message by computing its SHA-256 hash value (use the MessageDigest class with SHA-256). The first two bytes of the hash value of the real message are 3 and 59, respectively.

Sincerely,
Professor Moriarty
