Mr. Moran,

To protect the identity of my agent from those nosy detectives, I have encrypted the description of his physical appearance.
For the encryption, I used AES in CBC mode without any padding (NoPadding) with an all-zero IV and all-zero key. Unfortunately, the three blocks of the ciphertext seem to have been mixed up, and they are in the wrong order. Please rearrange them before decryption.

Sincerely,
Prof. Moriarty
